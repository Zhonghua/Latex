\section{Conclusion and Outlook}
\label{sec:conclusion}

A set of benchmarks that can be used to assess the
ability of adaptive FEM codes to handle for diverse
problems have been presented in this paper.
Numerical results with twelve test problems demonstrate
that ......
So far we have just solved linear PDE problems where $u$ 
was a continuous approximation in the $H^1$ space. 
Hermes can also solve equations whose solutions lie in the space
$Hcurl$, $Hdiv$ or $L^2$ and one can combine these spaces for PDE systems.


The purpose of this papaer is to ......(coming soon.)
