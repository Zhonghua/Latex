\section{Conclusion and Outlook}
\label{sec:conclusion}

A set of benchmarks that can be used to assess the
ability of adaptive FEM codes to handle for diverse
problems have been presented in this paper.
Numerical results with twelve test problems demonstrate
that ......

So far we have just solved linear PDE problems where $u$
was a continuous approximation in the $H^1$ space.
Hermes can also solve equations whose solutions lie in the space
$Hcurl$, $Hdiv$ or $L^2$ and one can combine these spaces for PDE systems.

The computations were performed on an Intel Core i3 based laptop PC
operating under the 32 bit VMware Fedora 12 distribution
of Linux with kernel 2.6.31.5-127.fc12.i686.PAE
on Windows XP professional(1GB memory for VMware Workstation). 

The obtained rate confirms the theoretical estimates. 
Notice that the hp strategy consistently outperforms the h adaptivity.

The purpose of this papaer is to ......(coming soon.)
