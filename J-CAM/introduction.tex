\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The number of adaptive Finite Element codes is growing.
%Let us mention (in alphabetical order): Alberta
%\cite{alberta}, DealII \cite{dealii}, FEniCS
%\cite{fenics}, FETK \cite{fetk}, Hermes \cite{hermes},
%libMesh \cite{libmesh}, Phaml \cite{phaml}, PHG \cite{phg},
%2dhp90 \cite{2dhp90}, and others.
There is no common approach to test adaptive
Finite Element algorithms. The obstacle in developing such an approach is that
the codes differ in application platforms, ways of loading the physical model,
grid formats, boundary conditions handling, input/output formats and the list could go on.

Moreover, some Finite Element codes are specifically designed to be used for
a narrow profile of problems, which also limits the possibility of comparing
their performance on a single problem.
For instance, some of the them widely used in the aerospace industry, others are
mostly used in civil engineering or electrical engineering and electronic engineering.
Therefore, in order to compare efficiency and robustness of the Finite Element
codes, various test problems are required.

For some classical Finite Element problems, pre-processing
needed for various codes differs greatly.
As a result of the differences between the codes,
the same algorithm may give different results and convergency
behavior for the same problem.

The criterion of performance for adaptive algorithms
is the obtained accuracy as a function of the total number
of DOFs (Degrees Of Freedom) and CPU time. However,
this is quite difficult to establish for CPU time because
the various codes may run on different hardware.

At this point we would like to acknowledge the work of
Dr. William Mitchell (NIST) who collected a suite of
twelve benchmarks for adaptive FEM \cite{mitchell-1}.
The aim of these is to compare different algorithms
using a test set of problems with known exact solutions
that are able to test various aspects of automatic
adaptivity in the appropriate manner.

In this paper, we solve the twelve benchmarks.
The test problems and their exact solutions are
formulated in Sections \ref{sec:bench-1} - \ref{sec:bench-12}.
We also present solutions obtained by {\sc Hermes} library (http://hpfem.org/hermes).
{\sc Hermes} is a multi-platform open source C++
library for rapid development of adaptive $hp$-FEM
and $hp$-DG solvers. Each section also contains a short
description of the benchmark problem, then the numerical
results are presented and discussed. Conclusion and outlooks
are offered in the last section of the paper.
