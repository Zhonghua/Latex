\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The number of adaptive finite element libraries is growing
-- let us mention (in alphabetical order) for example Alberta
\cite{alberta}, DealII \cite{dealii}, FEniCS
\cite{fenics}, FETK \cite{fetk}, Hermes \cite{hermes}, libMesh \cite{libmesh},
Phaml \cite{phaml}, PHG \cite{phg}, 2dhp90 \cite{2dhp90} and there are many others.\\
A natural question that arises is how do they compare to each other?
Unfortunately, comparison efforts are usually inhibited at the very beginning
by diverse installation requirements, supporting libraries, input and output
data formats, and different usage of various codes. And even if these problems
could be overcome, not many benchmarks with known exact solutions are
available to test various aspects of automatic adaptivity.
At this point we would like to acknowledge the pioneering work of Dr. William Mitchell
(NIST) who not only collected a suite of 12 benchmark problems
for adaptive FEM \cite{mitchell-1}, but who also implemented
and compared several $hp$-adaptive finite element algorithms by various
authors \cite{mitchell-2}.
This paper presents twelve parametrized test problems with different behaved
solutions (contained in \cite{mitchell-1}) that are
designed to test the ability of adaptive algorithms.
The test problems and their
solutions are formulated in Sections \ref{sec:bench-1} - \ref{sec:bench-12}.
{\sc Hermes} is an open source C++ library for
rapid development of adaptive $hp$-FEM and $hp$-DG solvers.
In each section we show for illustration sample results obtained with the open
source {\sc Hermes} library (http://hpfem.org/hermes).
