\section{Benchmark NIST-7 "Boundary Line Singularity"}
\label{sec:bench-7}

This is a singularity problem with the solution that is singular along the left part of the boundary.
The equation solved in this problem is the Poisson's equation.

\begin{equation} \label{boundary-line-singularity}
-\Delta u = f
\end{equation}
in the domain $\Omega = (0, 1)^2$, equipped with Dirichlet boundary conditions
given by the exact solution. The exact solution is
$u(x,y) = x^{\alpha}$,
where $\alpha \geq 0.5$ determines the strength of the singularity.
The right-hand side $f$ is calculated by inserting exact solution into (\ref{boundary-line-singularity}).
The solution of NIST-7 with $\alpha = 0.6$ is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:sln-nist07}.

three approaches to automatic adaptivity from the point
of view of DOF and CPU convergence.
